## Privacy Policy

We respect your privacy. Edge Translate doesn't track you or transfer your data to third parties. Also, we wrote this Privacy Policy in plain English, so you don't need a PhD in law to understand it.

### What information do we collect

We only collect telemetry data for better user experience.

Telemetry data is anonymous data that shows us which buttons are clicked, which features are used, and by how many people. Again, no PII (personally-identifiable information) is collected. This only helps us understand the overall user behavior and is vital in product design.

Currently, telemetry data includes the following components:

* a unique random id, for counting the number of users

* your language preference and the country you located in, for improving localization

* your operating system type and browser type, for improving performance on different platform

* the name and version of current extension, for statistics

We use Google Analytics to help us collect and manage the data, but what is collected is completely controlled by us, which means you won't be bothered by Google Ads.

### Browser permissions to all pages

You may find it suspicious that our extension request permission to access all visited web pages as well as browsing history. It's the permission that enables us to inject translation scripts to all pages. Those scripts help you translate full websites, highlight text on sites and translate it with a simple shortcut, or by double-clicking.

Browser vendors named this permission a little misleading. We're also bitter about it. We don't access your history. We don't keep track of the pages you visited. Injecting translations scripts is literally the only thing we're using from that permission.
